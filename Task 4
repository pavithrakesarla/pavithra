------------Nested if statement-------
        A Nested if statement is an if statement that is placed inside another if statement.
        This allows for multiple conditions to be evaluated sequentially ,providing more complex decision making capabilites.


---------------When for loop becomes infinite------------- 
   
  An infinite for loop has no termination condition, causing it to iterate indefinitely. 
  This can happen if the termination condition is missing or if the loop's increment/decrement logic prevents the condition from being false.

Example:-

class InfiniteForLoop
{
public static void main (String args[]){
                for(int i=10; i>0; i++){
                System.out.println("java")
    }
 }
} 
----output----
